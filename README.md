## Installation

To use this website, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

## Setup

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned React app.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the App

1. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the cloned React app if you're not already there.

2. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and automatically open the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

   If the app doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

   If you make changes to the code in the application and save them, they will automatically be updated on your localhost (given that they successfully compile)
